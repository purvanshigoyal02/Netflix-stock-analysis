Objective

The primary objectives of this project are:
1.	Analyze the volume of Netflix stock traded over time.
2.	Examine Netflix stock prices, including high, open, and close prices.
3.	Investigate stock price trends on a daily, monthly, and yearly basis.
4.	Identify the top 5 dates with the highest and lowest stock prices.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains Netflix stock information from 2002 to 2022. It includes the following columns:
•	Date: The date of the trading session.
•	Open: The opening price of the stock on that date.
•	High: The highest price of the stock on that date.
•	Low: The lowest price of the stock on that date.
•	Close: The closing price of the stock on that date.
•	Volume: The volume of stock traded on that date.

Libraries Used
To perform the analysis and visualization, the following Python libraries are utilized:
•	NumPy: For numerical operations and handling arrays.
•	Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
•	Seaborn: For statistical data visualization.
•	Matplotlib: For creating static, interactive, and animated visualizations.

Data Cleaning
Data cleaning is a crucial step in data analysis to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the results. In this project, data cleaning involves:
•	Handling missing values.
•	Converting data types to appropriate formats.
•	Ensuring consistency in data entries.
